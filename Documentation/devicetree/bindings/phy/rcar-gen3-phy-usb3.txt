* Renesas R-Car generation 3 USB 3.0 PHY

This file provides information on what the device node for the R-Car generation
3 USB 3.0 PHY contains.
If you want to enable spread spectrum clock (ssc) and/or use USB_EXTAL instead
of USB3_CLK, you need this driver. However, if you don't want to these feature,
you don't need this driver.

Required properties:
- compatible: "renesas,usb3-phy-r8a7795" if the device is a part of an R8A7795
	      SoC.
	      "renesas,usb3-phy-r8a7796" if the device is a part of an R8A7796
	      SoC.
	      "renesas,rcar-gen3-usb3-phy" for a generic R-Car Gen3 compatible
	      device.

	      When compatible with the generic version, nodes must list the
	      SoC-specific version corresponding to the platform first
	      followed by the generic version.

- reg: offset and length of the USB 3.0 PHY register block.
- clocks: clock phandle and specifier pair(s).
- #phy-cells: see phy-bindings.txt in the same directory, must be <0>.

Optional properties:
- renesas,ssc-range: Enable/disable spread spectrum clock (ssc) by using
		     the following values as u32:
			- 0 (or the property doesn't exist): disable the ssc
			- 4980: enable the ssc as -4980 ppm
			- 4492: enable the ssc as -4492 ppm
			- 4003: enable the ssc as -4003 ppm
- renesas,usb-extal: Use USB_[E]XTAL pins instead of USB3S0_CLK_[PN].

Example (R-Car H3):

	usb-phy@e65ee000 {
		compatible = "renesas,usb3-phy-r8a7795",
			     "renesas,rcar-gen3-usb3-phy";
		reg = <0 0xe65ee000 0 0x90>;
		clocks = <&cpg CPG_MOD 328>;
	};
